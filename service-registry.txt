A service registry is a database used to keep track of the available instances of each microservice in an application. 

A service registry is a phone book for your microservices. Each service registers itself with the service registry and tells the registry where it lives (host, port, node name) and perhaps other service-specific metadata - things that other services can use to make informed decisions about it. Clients can ask questions about the service topology (“are there any ‘fulfillment-services’ available, and if so, where?”) and service capabilities (“can you handle X, Y, and Z?”). You probably already use a technology that has some notion of a cluster (Cassandra, Memcached, etc.), and that information is ideally stored in a service registry.

There are several popular options for service registries. Netflix built and then open-sourced their own service registry, Eureka. 

Eureka Server is an application that holds the information about all client-service applications. Every Micro service will register into the Eureka server and Eureka server knows all the client applications running on each port and IP address. Eureka Server is also known as Discovery Server.
