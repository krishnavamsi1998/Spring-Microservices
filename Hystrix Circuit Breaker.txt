In this tutorial, we'll cover Spring Cloud Netflix Hystrix – the fault tolerance library. We’ll use the library and implement the Circuit Breaker enterprise pattern, which is describing a strategy against failure cascading at different levels in an application.

The principle is analogous to electronics: Hystrix is watching methods for failing calls to related services. If there is such a failure, it will open the circuit and forward the call to a fallback method.

The library will tolerate failures up to a threshold. Beyond that, it leaves the circuit open. Which means, it will forward all subsequent calls to the fallback method, to prevent future failures. This creates a time buffer for the related service to recover from its failing state.
